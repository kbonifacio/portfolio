                        <p className="text">As an 18 year old, I began my journey into the gaming industry world (and the adult world). I learned first hand the process of "white glove" service in regard to customer experience. During this time, I learned how to observe and ask questions as I dove into the unknown with each new guest. I loved helping our guests feel secure and happy with not only their purchase, but their overall experience.  </p>

                        <p className="text">As a Senior Game Advisor, I was introduced to the concept of mentoring others. My position was the liason between entry level staff members and mangerial staff. In addition to my duties of tending to guests, I was able to train and guide the staff under my purvue. While managerial staff were off dudty, I maintained the title of "Manager on Duty", taking on additional responsibilities to care for my staff and guests. </p>

                        <p className="text">The position of Assistant Store Manager was a great experience. I learned how to balance my duties as a manager and delegate as appropriate to my staff. I spent a lot of time in this role self-reflecting on what the word "leader" meant. I came to the conclusion that a leader not only leads by example, but is also cognizant of the needs, wants, and aspirations of their staff. As as leader, I worked to guide my staff on the inner workings of our company as I learned how small changes can make a large impact on our success as a team. In addition to this, I encouraged my staff to take steps towards their goals within and outside of the company. I discovered that communication and genuine interest in the well-being of others is truly the foundation of a great working relationships.</p>

This was a humbling experience that I will hold onto forever. I learned that I will never fully understand what the person next to me may be facing and that life is precious.  </p>

I researched wild life during field studies, the water quality of the Sacramento river, alzheimer's disease, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The technical experience and soft skills I gained while at Sac State have guided me in my work and in other avenues of life.   </p>

                        <p className="text">Prior to my last semester at Sacramento State, I was introduced to coding through Swift Playgrounds for MacOS. I immediately was engrossed with solving the main character's problems through coding in Swift. It was not long after that I found that FullStack Academy was hosting a new 26-week web development program through California State East Bay. I applied and decided to leap into the world of coding. I realized that I had found a career field that I truly saw myself being a part of and loving it. </p>

I was able to fulfill a long-term life goal and I was filled with pride. I am a first generation college student who hopes to inspire the younger children within my family to pursue their passions. My struggles and achievements will act as a guide and foundations for the journies of those around me.   </p>

Despite obtaining a degree in a different STEM major, I was able to apply the soft skills and study skills that I had learned throughout my college experience to be successful within the program. I experienced what it was like to work alongside other developers and develop and test code. I learned JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Angular, React, Node.JS, PostgreSQL, Single Page Application methodology, Agile methodology, Git, Netlify, Heroku, and more. </p>
